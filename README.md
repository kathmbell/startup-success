# startup-success

In an industry with high levels of uncertainty, the casual observer can believe that when a startup company is successful it is a random event.

From the perspective of the startup, I want to evaluate the probability of achieving a success and stable company state -- either IPO or Series D.

The scope of this project will only encompass companies headquartered in Silicon Valley and San Francisco and if they are founded after 2009. By restricting companies to this region, I am assuming that the funding deals are of a structure.
